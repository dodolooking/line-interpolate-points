# line interpolate points
A Node module that interpolates the coordinates of any number of equidistant points along a line composed of one *or
more* line segments. It's particularly useful for GIS applications, and is analogous to the PostGIS
`ST_LineInterpolatePoint()` and Python Shapely's `shapely.geometry.LineString.interpolate()`.
